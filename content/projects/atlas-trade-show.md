## Project Overview

Massive 50' x 40' two-story trade show booth graphics for Atlas Construction Products at the International Builders' Show. The booth showcases their complete product line including roofing systems, waterproofing, and construction accessories to contractors and builders.

## Challenge

Atlas needed graphics that would:
- Stand out in a massive convention hall
- Communicate product diversity clearly
- Work across two stories (20+ feet high)
- Integrate with existing booth architecture
- Support multiple product demonstrations
- Maintain brand consistency across huge format

Key requirements:
- Large-format digital printing (wall-sized graphics)
- Integration with LED backlighting
- Modular panels for reconfiguration
- Product photography at heroic scale
- Installation coordination with booth builders

## Solution

Developed a comprehensive graphics package featuring:
- 20-foot tall hero product photography
- Category-based color coding system
- Integrated product benefit messaging
- LED-backlit translucent panels
- Modular graphic system for flexibility
- Wayfinding graphics for two-story navigation

Graphics were designed to work at multiple viewing distances - bold imagery and messaging for across-the-hall visibility, detailed product information for close engagement. The system balances dramatic visual impact with functional product communication for serious trade show attendees.

Project deadline: January 7, 2026 for IBS show.

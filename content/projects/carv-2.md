## Project Overview

Retail display concept for Carv's revolutionary ski coaching technology. The display needed to communicate the 2-sensor system and sell the product without staff assistance in specialty ski shops.

## Challenge

Carv 2 represents sophisticated technology—real-time ski coaching through sensors and AI. The challenge was making this technical product approachable in retail while maintaining premium brand positioning.

Key requirements:
- Communicate 2-sensor system clearly
- Allow customer interaction with demo unit
- Solve cable management issues
- Premium materials to match $400+ product price point
- Easy assembly for shop staff

## Solution

Interactive display featuring:
- Clear acrylic housing showcasing the technology
- Integrated LED lighting to draw attention
- Cable management system hidden in base
- Demo unit secured but accessible
- Premium finishes matching Carv's brand standards

The design uses geometric forms that echo Carv's visual language while creating clear sight lines to product features.

## Execution

Concept designed by Garrison Brooks, fabricated and installed by Crux Retail. Display successfully deployed to specialty ski retailers.

## Results

Client feedback praised the clear communication of technical features and the premium feel matching their brand positioning. Display helped customers understand the product value without requiring sales staff intervention.

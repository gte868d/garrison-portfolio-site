## Project Overview

Interactive retail display system for Delta's premium faucet lines in home improvement stores. The display needed to enable hands-on product testing while communicating Delta's technology advantages in a crowded, competitive category.

## Challenge

Delta needed to:
- Enable working water demonstrations in-store
- Showcase touch2o and voice-activated technology
- Differentiate premium finishes and styles
- Communicate durability and warranty
- Stand out against Mohler, Kohler, and other competitors
- Work within big-box retail constraints

Key requirements:
- Integrated plumbing for live demos
- Durable construction for constant customer use
- Premium appearance matching product quality
- Clear technology feature callouts
- Easy maintenance for store staff

## Solution

Created a comprehensive display featuring:
- Working water demonstrations for key models
- Interactive technology demo stations
- Premium finish comparison area
- Corrugated construction with high-quality graphics
- Integrated LED lighting for premium feel
- Modular design for different retail footprints

The display focuses on hands-on experience - customers can actually operate the touch and voice features, feel the spray patterns, and compare finishes. Graphics explain the technology without overwhelming, using clear benefit-focused messaging. Construction balances cost-effectiveness with the premium brand image Delta requires.

## Project Overview

Comprehensive mobile trade show experience showcasing Dometic's complete product ecosystem for RV and overlanding markets. The trailer serves as both a showroom and educational platform.

## Challenge

Dometic needed to consolidate multiple product lines (awnings, climate control, power systems, sanitation) into a cohesive mobile experience that works at trade shows ranging from World of Concrete to Overland Expo.

## Solution

Multi-zone trailer design with:
- Awnings zone with portable counter displays
- Climate control demonstrations
- Power systems with live solar integration
- Product education zones
- Fold-away displays for storage

My role focused on pen-and-ink concept ideation for each product zone, developing the spatial flow and educational story throughout the trailer.

## Results

The mobile showroom successfully launched at Overland Expo with positive feedback on the educational approach and product integration. Dometic reported increased engagement compared to traditional booth setups.

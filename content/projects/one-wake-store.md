## Project Overview

Complete store concept and environmental graphics for One Wake, a wakeboarding and watersports lifestyle brand. The project involved translating the brand's high-energy, community-focused identity into a physical retail environment that functions as both a store and a community gathering space.

## Challenge

One Wake needed:
- Retail environment matching their lifestyle brand energy
- Integration of community event space
- Product merchandising supporting multiple categories (boards, gear, apparel)
- Environmental graphics bringing the water to the store
- Flexibility for seasonal product changes
- Experience that resonates with core wakeboarding community

Key requirements:
- Brand immersion without overwhelming product
- Space for community events and athlete meet-ups
- Instagram-worthy moments for social sharing
- Efficient use of limited retail square footage
- Budget-conscious materials and fabrication

## Solution

Developed a comprehensive store concept featuring:
- Environmental graphics inspired by wake patterns
- Modular fixture system for flexible merchandising
- Community gathering zone with seating
- Product display integrating brand storytelling
- Photo moment opportunities throughout space
- Material palette of concrete, wood, and branded graphics

The design brings the energy of being on the water into the retail space. Graphics create immersive moments without competing with product. The layout prioritizes community gathering while maintaining strong product visibility. Fixtures and graphics designed for in-house fabrication to control costs while maintaining brand premium feel.

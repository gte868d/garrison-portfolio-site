## Project Overview

Comprehensive 9-foot retail bay system for Trex composite decking displays. Solution needed to showcase multiple product lines, color options, and accessories while educating DIY customers and contractors on the benefits of composite vs. wood decking.

## Challenge

Trex required a display that would:
- Showcase 20+ decking color options
- Enable hands-on material comparison
- Display railing and fastener systems
- Communicate maintenance-free benefits
- Differentiate premium vs. standard lines
- Work in big-box retail environments (Home Depot, Lowe's)

Key requirements:
- Accommodate full-size decking samples
- Integrated color selection tools
- Clear product hierarchy
- Durability for high customer interaction
- Easy restocking for store associates

## Solution

Created a modular bay system featuring:
- Tiered sample display for all color options
- Interactive texture comparison panels
- Integrated product literature holders
- Feature benefit callouts with graphics
- Accessory integration zones
- Powder-coated steel construction

The design uses actual Trex decking materials as structural and graphic elements, allowing the product itself to communicate quality. Color samples are organized by collection with clear premium vs. standard differentiation. Graphics focus on long-term value and environmental benefits.

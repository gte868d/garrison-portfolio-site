              20 Years Solving How Products Meet Consumers
            </h2>
            <p>
              I'm an industrial designer who has spent two decades in the trenches of retail design—from 
              sketching concepts on napkins to watching displays ship to 2,000+ stores. My work spans 
              corrugated POP displays to trade show environments, automotive aftermarket to medical devices, 
              sheet metal to acrylic to vacuum-formed plastics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently Creative Director at Peachtree Packaging & Display in Lawrenceville, GA, where I 
              lead design for corrugated retail displays and packaging. Working remotely allows me to also 
              take on select freelance projects through partners like Crux Retail and Porchlight Studios—typically 
              work involving materials, scales, or applications outside my day-to-day scope.

              The Method: Rocks in a Tumbler
            </h2>
            <p>
              My design process draws from an analogy Steve Jobs used to love: when you put rough rocks 
              in a tumbler with water and grit, they bang against each other. The collisions knock off the 
              rough edges. What emerges are smooth, beautiful stones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Great design works the same way. For every project, I generate 15-30 rapid concept sketches—not 
              to show off volume, but because the right solution rarely appears in the first three ideas. 
              These concepts collide with each other, with client constraints, with manufacturing realities, 
              with retail requirements. The friction reveals what works.
            </p>
            <p>
              This "rocks in a tumbler" methodology has served clients from Coca-Cola to Home Depot, 
              automotive accessories to ski technology, medical equipment to premium spirits.

              The Evolution: AI as Thinking Tool
            </h2>
            <p>
              About two years ago, I started experimenting with a different kind of collision: using AI 
              to create virtual expert panels before I even start sketching. Instead of discovering constraints 
              after drawing 20 concepts, I now stress-test ideas through debates between imaginary retail 
              buyers, manufacturing engineers, brand managers, and end users.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI doesn't design for me—it helps me think more systematically about problems before 
              committing resources to solutions. It's pattern recognition at scale: "What would a retail 
              buyer say about this?" "How would a manufacturer flag this issue?" "Where's the brand manager 
              going to push back?"
            </p>
            <p>
              I sketch fewer concepts now, but they're better concepts. The ones that survive the virtual 
              war room are pre-vetted against multiple perspectives. It's still rocks in a tumbler—just a 
              faster, more thorough tumbler.

                AskBetter
              </a>
              —a platform that transforms simple questions into sophisticated debates between multiple 
              expert perspectives. It's the same systematic thinking I've applied to design problems, 
              now accessible for anyone making decisions.

            <p>
              The connection is direct: 20 years of solving spatial, material, and manufacturing challenges 
              taught me that the best solutions emerge from rigorous collision of ideas. AskBetter makes 
              that collision process available beyond design.
